Engage busts out of the black square grid and allows the user to show their creativity while increasing productivity. Engage will make collaboration easier, more effective, and much more enjoyable.

As a remote worker, I am constantly thinking of ways to improve video conferencing. 

The large black boxes on my screen all day have always felt uninspiring. Seeing online classrooms is even more jarring. In school, the teachers would always decorate their rooms with so much color and vibrance. Where is that vibrance now? 

With Zoom Engage, I wanted to bring it back. In doing so, Zoom can leverage the preference shown to its platform to pull ahead in market share.

SO many companies are trying to compete in the video conferencing arena. But they all use the same uninspired black boxes.

##### What if we broke away from this? <br>
##### What if we let the user decide what their work environment or classroom would look like? <br>
##### How much more creativity and productivity could we generate? <br>
##### How much much more preference for the Zoom platform could we foster? <br>
#### I am ready to find out. <br>

## For a new remote environments, whether that is at work, in the classroom, or catching up with friends, everyone deserves a place where they can feel like themselves and express their creativity. Not be boxed in.
